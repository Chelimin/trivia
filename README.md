# Trivia

First project for WDI-2 in Singapore. 

An expandable trivia game with (60s) timer, written with Javascript Object-Oriented Programming, so that more questions with numerical answers can be added easily.

Frog and lilies are to add a fun element but can be changed into something else to keep score.
