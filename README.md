# Trivia

First project for General Assembly's Web Development Immersive program in Singapore. 

An expandable trivia game with (60s) timer, written with Javascript Object-Oriented Programming, so that more questions can be added easily.

Help save Froggy from the hungry snake by answering the questions shown (only numerical answers accepted). A lily will pop up with each correct answer to allow him to cross the pond. Frog and lilies are to add a fun element, but can be changed into something else for keeping score.
